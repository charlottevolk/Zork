/**
 * Class Game - the main class of the "Zork" game.
 *
 * Author: Michael Kolling Version: 1.1 Date: March 2000
 * 
 * This class is the main class of the "Zork" application. Zork is a very
 * simple, text based adventure game. Users can walk around some scenery. That's
 * all. It should really be extended to make it more interesting!
 * 
 * To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play"
 * routine.
 * 
 * This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all rooms,
 * creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates the commands that
 * the parser returns.
